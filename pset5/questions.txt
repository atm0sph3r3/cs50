2.  An image compressed using lossless compression doesn't lose
    any detail when uncompressed, whereas lossy compression
    will produce only an approximate recreation of the orginal
    when uncompressed.

4.  First, the first character of the filename in the directory is
    changed to indicate that the file has been deleted and the
    space it occupied can be reused. The file's clusters (part of the
    sector) are reclaimed and moved to the list of free clusters.
5.  Physically destroy the drive, degauss it, or repeatedly overwrite
    it with zeroes or a pattern
6.  A header file containing signed and unsigned integer types
    with a specific width (# of bits)
7.  If the application is ported, the size of the date types are defined.
    Here, it allows one to define variables with a distinct size, which
    can be matched to real-world objects.
8.  1,4,4,2
9.  ASCII: BM 
10. bfSize is the total size of the file and biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct.
11. The pixels are ordered top to bottom, beginning in the left corner.
12. biBitCount
13. The user doesn't have permission to open the file (e.g. they're not
    the owner and the permissions are 600).
14. The structs have a defined size, so only one of them is read at
    a time.

16. Changes the byte position of the pointer inside the file.
